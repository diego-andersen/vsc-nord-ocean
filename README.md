# Nord-ocean theme
Uninspired name for VSCode theme with Nord colours, but Base16 Ocean syntax highlighting.


Default Nord is incredibly annoying in the way that it colours everything various shades of blue, so that you can't actually tell code apart. This theme fixes that (for Python, for now) by using the more sane highlighting definitions inspired by Base16 themes.

General gist:
- Grey comments/docstrings
- Green strings
- Blue functions and methods
- Yellow classes and string interpolation
- Red self (might make kwargs red too in the future, like Base16)
- Orange numbers and bools
- Magenta/purple keywords and operators
- Cyan builtins
- White everything else

To-do list:
- Second pass on Python
- Start on other languages
